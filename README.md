# Docker GIS Project

We are using Docker to manage all the geographical data and perform calculations efficiently.

## Prerequisites

* Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

## Setup

1. Create a folder for your project.
2. Clone the repo in the created folder:
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/causape/opensourceGIS_docker.git

# Docker GIS Stack Setup

# Automated Docker GIS Stack: OSM Incremental Processing & Spatial Analysis

This repository contains a containerized GIS environment designed for automated OpenStreetMap (OSM) data ingestion, incremental updates, and custom spatial analysis. The stack transforms raw OSM data into "Service Islands" with aggregated infrastructure data using a Python-based analytical engine.

## 1. System Services

| Service | Image | Purpose | Persistence & Access |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **postgis_db** | `postgis/postgis:15-3.3` | Core PostGIS database. | **Port:** 5431 |
| **geoserver_app** | `kartoza/geoserver` | OGC Map Server (WFS/WMS). | [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (`admin` / `admin_geoserver`) |
| **pgadmin_app** | `dpage/pgadmin4` | Web-based Database UI. | [http://localhost:5050](http://localhost:5050) |
| **osm2pgsql_importer**| `overv/tile-server` | Initial bootstrap loader. | Runs once (SQL Dump > PBF). |
| **osm_updater** | `Custom Python/Alpine` | Analytical engine & updater. | **Continuous 1-hour cycle**. |

---

## 2. Data Workflow

### A. Initial Import Logic
When the stack starts, `import_osm.sh` follows a priority-based bootstrap:
* **Fast Import (SQL Dump):** If `/data/filtered_osm_data.sql.gz` exists, it restores the database directly for immediate deployment.
### B. Standard Import (PBF)
If no dump is found, the system downloads the latest **Germany PBF** and executes `osm2pgsql` in **Flex Output** mode using the `styles/osm.lua` schema. 

**How the Lua engine processes the Germany dataset:**
Instead of importing the entire OpenStreetMap database (which would be hundreds of gigabytes), the `osm.lua` script acts as a high-performance filter that scans every node and way to build a specialized schema:

* **Rule-Based Filtering:** The engine inspects specific OSM tags (`amenity`, `leisure`, `highway`, `landuse`) to determine which features are relevant for urban analysis.
* **Infrastructure Classification:**
    * **Education:** Filters nodes and polygons tagged as `school`, `kindergarten`, `childcare`, or `social_facility`, splitting them into point (`education_poi`) and area (`education_area`) tables.
    * **Leisure & Recreation:** Isolates `playground`, `pitch`, `sports_centre`, and `track` features into dedicated leisure tables.
    * **Public Transport:** Specifically extracts `tram_station` nodes for transport accessibility analysis.
    * **Connectivity:** Filters `highway=pedestrian` ways to identify walkable zones.
* **On-the-fly Projection:** All geometries are automatically projected to **EPSG:3857** (Web Mercator) during the import process to ensure they are ready for high-speed spatial calculations in PostGIS.



### C. The Updater Loop (`osm_updater`)
This service runs a continuous 60-minute loop to keep data current:
1. **Apply Diffs:** Scans `./data/diffs/` for `.osc.gz` files and applies them via `osm2pgsql --append` to update source tables.
2. **Trigger `app.py`:** Executes the Python analysis engine to recalculate spatial buffers.
3. **Generate Dump:** Generates a fresh `.sql.gz` dump for future fast-start deployments.
4. **Idle Phase:** Sleeps for 1 hour before the next check.

---

## 3. Spatial Analysis Pipeline (`app.py`)

The `app.py` script is the core analytical engine, transforming raw features into structured "Service Islands".

### Phase I: Single Feature Buffering
The system identifies infrastructure (schools, tram stops, playgrounds) and generates a **100-meter proximity buffer** around each:
* **Coordinate Transformation:** Data is transformed from `EPSG:3857` to `EPSG:4326` for consistent geography-based buffering.
* **Deduplication:** A `UNIQUE` constraint on `original_osm_id` prevents duplicate geometries even if an update process restarts.

### Phase II: Spatial Partitioning (Grid Mode)
To handle large-scale datasets like the whole of Germany without exceeding RAM limits:
* **Grid Creation:** The map is divided into a virtual grid of 0.005-degree squares.
* **Clustering:** Overlapping buffers are grouped within these cells using `ST_ClusterIntersecting`.

### Phase III: Data Absorption & Aggregation
When buffers overlap, they dissolve into a single "Service Island" that absorbs data from its constituent parts:
* **Element Count:** Calculates the total number of services within that specific island.
* **Category Aggregation:** Collects a distinct list of all categories present (e.g., "education, transport").
* **Detailed Information String:** Uses `string_agg` to list every sub-type and facility name (e.g., `school: Grundschule Haidmühle | tram_station: Unknown`).
* **Spatial Union:** Geometries are dissolved using `ST_UnaryUnion` with `ST_SnapToGrid` for clean multipolygons.


## 4. Geospatial Ops Dashboard
To streamline operations and visualization, the project includes a custom Node.js Dashboard that unifies DevOps and GIS workflows in a single interface. This allows for real-time monitoring of the Docker stack while visually inspecting the generated "Service Islands."

### Key Features
Real-Time Docker Logs: Uses dockerode and socket.io to stream live logs from the postgis_db container (or others) directly to an embedded Xterm.js terminal in the browser. This eliminates the need to context-switch between CLI and map.

### WMS/WFS Integration:

* **Visualization:** Consumes WMS tiles from GeoServer (gis_project:city_buffers_merged) to render the analysis results over a MapLibre GL JS basemap.

* **Interactivity:** Uses WFS GetFeature requests to query data attributes on click.

* **Nominatim Search:** Integrated geocoding to quickly fly to specific cities or regions for inspection.

* **Rich Data UI:** A custom card-based side panel parses the complex DETAILED_INFO strings, displaying amenities with automatic icon mapping (e.g., 🎓 for schools, 🧸 for kindergartens).

Technical Highlight: Smart Feature Selection (QGIS-like Behavior)
The raw data consists of "merged" buffers which often stack vertically (e.g., a specific playground buffer sitting physically on top of a larger neighborhood buffer). Standard WFS queries return all intersecting geometries at a point, often causing the application to display the largest, underlying shape instead of the specific detail the user clicked.

To replicate the intuitive "Topmost Visible" selection behavior found in desktop GIS software like QGIS, the dashboard implements a client-side sorting algorithm using Turf.js:

* **Spatial Filter:** It verifies which specific geometry (Polygon or MultiPolygon) strictly contains the click coordinates using turf.booleanPointInPolygon.

* **Area Sort:* It calculates the geodesic area of all valid candidates (turf.area) and automatically selects the smallest feature.

* **Visual Highlight:* The selected geometry is immediately highlighted in yellow to provide clear visual feedback of the "island" being inspected.

This ensures that when a user clicks a small, specific detail (like a park), the application selects that specific element rather than the larger merged area underneath it, while maintaining the integrity of MultiPolygon structures.

### Dashboard Setup
The dashboard runs as a local Node.js service connecting to the Docker socket.

* **Navigate to the dashboard folder:**

Bash
```
cd Dashboard
```
Install dependencies: This installs express (web server), socket.io (real-time logs), dockerode (Docker API), and cors.


Bash
```
npm install
```
Start the server:


Bash
```
node server.js
```
Access the Interface: Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:3000

## 4. Performance & Setup

### Optimization
* **RAM Tuning:** `app.py` uses `work_mem = '1GB'` for large joins.
* **Flex Schema:** Filters specific OSM tags via `styles/osm.lua` for Education, Leisure, Transport, and Landuse.
* **Slim Mode:** `osm2pgsql` uses disk-based intermediate storage for large datasets.

### Setup Instructions
1. **Prerequisites:** Install Docker/Compose. Ensure all `.sh` files use **Unix (LF)** line endings.
2. **Configuration:** Create a `.env` file with credentials matching `app.py`.
3. **Deployment:**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
