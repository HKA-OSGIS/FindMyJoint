# Docker GIS Stack Setup

# Automated Docker GIS Stack: OSM Incremental Processing & Spatial Analysis

This repository contains a containerized GIS environment designed for automated OpenStreetMap (OSM) data ingestion, incremental updates, and custom spatial analysis. The stack transforms raw OSM data into "Service Islands" with aggregated infrastructure data using a Python-based analytical engine.

## 1. System Services

| Service | Image | Purpose | Persistence & Access |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **postgis_db** | `postgis/postgis:15-3.3` | Core PostGIS database. | **Port:** 5431 |
| **geoserver_app** | `kartoza/geoserver` | OGC Map Server (WFS/WMS). | [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (`admin` / `admin_geoserver`) |
| **pgadmin_app** | `dpage/pgadmin4` | Web-based Database UI. | [http://localhost:5050](http://localhost:5050) |
| **osm2pgsql_importer**| `overv/tile-server` | Initial bootstrap loader. | Runs once (SQL Dump > PBF). |
| **osm_updater** | `Custom Python/Alpine` | Analytical engine & updater. | **Continuous 1-hour cycle**. |

---

## 2. Data Workflow

### A. Initial Import Logic
When the stack starts, `import_osm.sh` follows a priority-based bootstrap:
* **Fast Import (SQL Dump):** If `/data/filtered_osm_data.sql.gz` exists, it restores the database directly for immediate deployment.
### B. Standard Import (PBF)
If no dump is found, the system downloads the latest **Germany PBF** and executes `osm2pgsql` in **Flex Output** mode using the `styles/osm.lua` schema. 

**How the Lua engine processes the Germany dataset:**
Instead of importing the entire OpenStreetMap database (which would be hundreds of gigabytes), the `osm.lua` script acts as a high-performance filter that scans every node and way to build a specialized schema:

* **Rule-Based Filtering:** The engine inspects specific OSM tags (`amenity`, `leisure`, `highway`, `landuse`) to determine which features are relevant for urban analysis.
* **Infrastructure Classification:**
    * **Education:** Filters nodes and polygons tagged as `school`, `kindergarten`, `childcare`, or `social_facility`, splitting them into point (`education_poi`) and area (`education_area`) tables.
    * **Leisure & Recreation:** Isolates `playground`, `pitch`, `sports_centre`, and `track` features into dedicated leisure tables.
    * **Public Transport:** Specifically extracts `tram_station` nodes for transport accessibility analysis.
    * **Connectivity:** Filters `highway=pedestrian` ways to identify walkable zones.
* **On-the-fly Projection:** All geometries are automatically projected to **EPSG:3857** (Web Mercator) during the import process to ensure they are ready for high-speed spatial calculations in PostGIS.



### C. The Updater Loop (`osm_updater`)
This service runs a continuous 60-minute loop to keep data current:
1. **Apply Diffs:** Scans `./data/diffs/` for `.osc.gz` files and applies them via `osm2pgsql --append` to update source tables.
2. **Trigger `app.py`:** Executes the Python analysis engine to recalculate spatial buffers.
3. **Generate Dump:** Generates a fresh `.sql.gz` dump for future fast-start deployments.
4. **Idle Phase:** Sleeps for 1 hour before the next check.

---

## 3. Spatial Analysis Pipeline (`app.py`)

The `app.py` script is the core analytical engine, transforming raw features into structured "Service Islands".

### Phase I: Single Feature Buffering
The system identifies infrastructure (schools, tram stops, playgrounds) and generates a **100-meter proximity buffer** around each:
* **Coordinate Transformation:** Data is transformed from `EPSG:3857` to `EPSG:4326` for consistent geography-based buffering.
* **Deduplication:** A `UNIQUE` constraint on `original_osm_id` prevents duplicate geometries even if an update process restarts.

### Phase II: Spatial Partitioning (Grid Mode)
To handle large-scale datasets like the whole of Germany without exceeding RAM limits:
* **Grid Creation:** The map is divided into a virtual grid of 0.005-degree squares.
* **Clustering:** Overlapping buffers are grouped within these cells using `ST_ClusterIntersecting`.

### Phase III: Data Absorption & Aggregation
When buffers overlap, they dissolve into a single "Service Island" that absorbs data from its constituent parts:
* **Element Count:** Calculates the total number of services within that specific island.
* **Category Aggregation:** Collects a distinct list of all categories present (e.g., "education, transport").
* **Detailed Information String:** Uses `string_agg` to list every sub-type and facility name (e.g., `school: Grundschule Haidmühle | tram_station: Unknown`).
* **Spatial Union:** Geometries are dissolved using `ST_UnaryUnion` with `ST_SnapToGrid` for clean multipolygons.


## 4. Geospatial Ops Dashboard
To streamline operations and visualization, the project includes a custom Node.js Dashboard that unifies DevOps and GIS workflows in a single interface. This allows for real-time monitoring of the Docker stack while visually inspecting the generated "Service Islands."

### Key Features
### 1. High-Performance Vector Rendering (MVT)
Unlike traditional WMS (server-side raster rendering), this dashboard consumes Vector Tiles (MVT) directly from GeoServer via GeoWebCache (application/vnd.mapbox-vector-tile).

* **Client-Side Rendering:** Data is styled dynamically in the browser using MapLibre GL JS, allowing for smooth zooming and rotation without pixelation.

* **Dynamic Styling:**  Colors and categorizations are applied in real-time based on the sub_type attribute (e.g., 🟧 Education, 🟩 Leisure, 🟦 Social), eliminating the need to regenerate server-side styles (SLD).

### 2. Interactive Filtering & Analysis
* **Real-time Filtering:** Users can toggle specific amenity categories (e.g., "Show only Schools and Playgrounds") instantly without reloading data, using MapLibre's setFilter capabilities.

* **Smart Selection Logic (QGIS-like Behavior):** To handle overlapping service areas, the application implements a custom sorting algorithm using Turf.js:
      * **1. Spatial Verification:**  Verifies strict containment using turf.booleanPointInPolygon.
      * **2. Area Sorting:** Calculates geodesic area (turf.area) and prioritizes the smallest feature first. This ensures that clicking on a small park inside a larger school zone selects the park preciseley, mimicking      desktop GIS UX.

### 3. Real-Time DevOps Monitoring
* **Live Docker Logs:** Integrates dockerode and socket.io to stream live logs from the PostGIS container directly to an embedded Xterm.js terminal in the browser. This allows for immediate verification of ETL processes and database triggers without context-switching.

### 4. Rich User Interface
* **WFS Data Retrieval:** While visualization uses lightweight Vector Tiles, clicking a feature triggers a precise WFS GetFeature request to fetch comprehensive attribute data.

* **Automated UI Parsing:** A custom side panel parses complex PostgreSQL arrays (DETAILED_INFO), automatically mapping keywords to visual icons (e.g., 🎓 for schools, 🧸 for kindergartens) for rapid readability.

* **Geocoding:** Integrated Nominatim search for quick navigation to specific cities or neighborhoods.

### 5. 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, MapLibre GL JS.

* **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Socket.io, Dockerode.

* **Geospatial Analysis:** Turf.js (Client-side), PostGIS (Server-side).

* **Protocols:** MVT (Vector Tiles), WFS (Web Feature Service), WSS (WebSockets).

### Dashboard Setup
The dashboard runs as a local Node.js service connecting to the Docker socket.

* **Navigate to the dashboard folder:**

Bash
```
cd Dashboard
```
Install dependencies: This installs express (web server), socket.io (real-time logs), dockerode (Docker API), and cors.


Bash
```
npm install
```
Start the server:


Bash
```
node server.js
```
Access the Interface: Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:3000

## Key Extra Functionalities

Beyond standard mapping, this application implements advanced logic to ensure strict compliance with the complexities of the German Cannabis Act (CanG), specifically regarding time-dependent restrictions.

### Dynamic Time-Fencing (Pedestrian Zones)
Unlike schools or playgrounds (which are restricted 24/7), Pedestrian Zones (Fußgängerzonen) have a unique legal status: cannabis consumption is only prohibited between 07:00 and 20:00.
* **Automatic Layer Control:** A global clock monitors the system time every second.
*  Day Mode (07:00 - 20:00): The system activates the Magenta layer for pedestrian zones, marking them as restricted areas.
*  Night Mode (20:00 - 07:00): The system automatically filters out and hides the pedestrian layer from the map, visually indicating that the restriction is lifted.
* **Simulation Mode:** A developer tool (Time Slider) allows users to manually shift the "App Time" to test the map's behavior and layer transitions between day and night without waiting for real-time changes.

### Smart Geofencing & Real-Time Alerts
The app uses the HTML5 Geolocation API combined with WFS (Web Feature Service) queries to protect the user in real-time. The logic goes beyond simple intersection checks; it implements a Decision Tree Algorithm to determine the safety status:
* **GPS Tracking:** The app watches the user's coordinate
    * **``` navigator.geolocation.watchPosition ```**
* **Spatial Query:** It queries GeoServer to see if the user's location intersects with any buffered polygon.
* **Context-Aware Status:**
    * **Scenario A (Fixed Restriction):** If the user is inside a School or Playground buffer → 🔴 NO SMOKING (Always Prohibited)
    * **Scenario B (Conditional Restriction):**
          * **If the user is inside a Pedestrian Zone:Is it Daytime? → 🔴 NO SMOKING (Restricted).**
          * **Is it Nighttime? → 🟢 SMOKING PERMITTED (The app ignores the polygon intersection based on the current time).**
 
## 4. Performance & Setup

### Optimization
* **RAM Tuning:** `app.py` uses `work_mem = '1GB'` for large joins.
* **Flex Schema:** Filters specific OSM tags via `styles/osm.lua` for Education, Leisure, Transport, and Landuse.
* **Slim Mode:** `osm2pgsql` uses disk-based intermediate storage for large datasets.

### Setup Instructions
1. **Prerequisites:** Install Docker/Compose. Ensure all `.sh` files use **Unix (LF)** line endings.
2. **Configuration:** Create a `.env` file with credentials matching `app.py`.
3. **Deployment:**
